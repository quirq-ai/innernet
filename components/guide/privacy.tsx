          Innernet keeps a copy of its index and its history in a small Postgres database. On your machine it is PGlite, Postgres compiled to WebAssembly, running
          inside the server on a folder at <C>~/.innernet/db</C> (folder mode 700). Nothing listens on a port, and local mode refuses the demo&apos;s database
          whatever the environment says, before a byte is sent:

        <p>
          The history folders stay the record. After each page you open, and whenever the history page is read, the files that changed are read into the database,
          only the new bytes of each. A session folder you delete, or a line you take out of a file, is forgotten there too. Only when the history folder itself is
          lost or replaced (the database notes which folder it read) does it keep the sessions that did not come with the new one, so <C>pnpm db:load</C> can write
          them back. Set <C>INNERNET_DB=off</C> and Innernet runs on its files alone; delete <C>~/.innernet/db</C> to forget the copy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sources lists everything the input generates, each with its path relative to the app or your home folder; this tab&apos;s row opens{" "}
          <C>innernet.jsonl</C> for editing, then reload History. Choosing GitHub repositories changes the content you browse; it moves nothing. The copy leaves
          this machine only if you connect a remote database, your own Neon, which asks you to confirm first: from then on the local index (folder paths, README
          text, agent instructions) and the history are kept in step with it, and your other machines&apos; history comes down, until you disconnect. Its URL
          stays in <C>~/.innernet/remote.json</C>, and the demo&apos;s database is refused as a remote.
        </p>
        <p>
          The public demo is different, and it is the one place anything you do is written to a server. When it has a database (Neon Postgres, in US East), it keeps
          the pages and searches its visitors open for {RETENTION_DAYS} days: per event, the kind of event, the page&apos;s path (none of the rest of its address
          but the search&apos;s own), its title or the search words, whether the back and forward buttons took you there, and the server&apos;s time, under a hash of
          the id the visitor&apos;s tab made, which gives back neither the id nor the time in it. Never an IP address, a user agent, a cookie or any other header.
          Nothing lists sessions, ids travel only in request bodies, so only a browser holding a session&apos;s id can read it back, and the Clear button on the
          history page deletes every one that browser sent. Each session holds at most {num(SESSION_CAP)} events and the whole demo stores at most{" "}
          {num(DAILY_CAP)} a day. A fork without a database keeps every visitor&apos;s history in their own browser, as the demo did before.
