// The database contract, shared by both drivers (lib/db/pglite.ts on this machine,

// ORM, just text with $1 placeholders and plain rows back.
//
// Values travel as text, numbers or booleans. JSON goes in as a string cast in the SQL
// ($1::jsonb) and comes back parsed. Times come back as numbers only when the SQL says so
// (see `epochMs` in lib/db/schema.ts), because the two drivers disagree on Date objects.
