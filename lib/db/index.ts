//          The same copy PGlite would keep: this machine's index and history.
//   demo   Neon through DATABASE_URL (lib/db/neon.ts). The server reads the demo index

//          history in it for 30 days (lib/db/demo-history.ts).

// back on the files, which stay the source of truth: data/index.json (or the demo's
// bundled data/demo/index.json) and the history folders.
//
// The instance lives on globalThis, so a hot reload in development reuses it rather than
// opening the folder a second time. A failure is retried a minute later at the soonest,
// and said once.
